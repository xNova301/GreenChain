                                            Statement:<br />The pervasive use of
                                            single-use plastics in packaging has
                                            led to significant environmental
                                            challenges, including plastic
                                            pollution in oceans, landfills
                                            overflowing with non-biodegradable
                                            waste, and harmful effects on
                                            wildlife and human health. In
                                            Vietnam, plastic waste is a pressing
                                            issue, with inadequate waste

                                            materials are not only
                                            environmentally damaging but also
                                            contribute to a cycle of
                                            unsustainable production and
